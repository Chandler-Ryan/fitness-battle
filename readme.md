# StepApp project

## Built while working along the Laracast 5.7 from scratch

Although following along, trying to apply my own project design requirements instead of copying the project done in the series.

Expanding the out of the box auth and using that user class, expanding it with values needed by the app and then linking that to the step entity with a hasMany relationship.
