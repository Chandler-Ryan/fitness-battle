# Fitness Battle project

## Built while working along the Laracast 5.7 from scratch
### Project has been evolved to also serve as my final project for my php class.

Although following along, trying to apply my own project design requirements instead of copying the project done in the series. Also due to requirements set by the final project am I veering further from the series design. I have closed the Github project that I used to manage the class project requiments.
* 5/16/2019 Final project has been presented in class pending final outcome.

* I have created a new Github project to track project progess for the development after the final project.
Expanding the out of the box auth and using that user class, expanding it with values needed by the app and then linking that to the step entity with a hasMany relationship. I have also used the DB Facade class to specify table joins using PDO/Active Record syntax in leiu of the hasMany Eloquent method in the action in the welcome controller that I used to feed the welcome page the data for the chart.
