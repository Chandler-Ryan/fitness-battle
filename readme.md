# Fitness Battle project
### Is the new name for the project

## Built while working along the Laracast 5.7 from scratch
### Project has been evolved to also serve as my final project for my php class.

Although following along, trying to apply my own project design requirements instead of copying the project done in the series. Also due to requirements set by the final project am I veering further from the series design.

Expanding the out of the box auth and using that user class, expanding it with values needed by the app and then linking that to the step entity with a hasMany relationship. I have also used the DB Facade class to specify table joins using PDO/Active Record syntax in leiu of the hasMany Eloquent method in the action in the welcome controller that I used to feed the welcome page the data for the chart.

*currently completed laracast 16*
